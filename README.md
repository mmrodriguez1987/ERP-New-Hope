# New Hope CRM

NHCRM is an Open Source Web Application with many modules that help with the Administration of a Church. The architecture of this software has its bases in the North American Culture for all the areas in which it was manufactured, but this is not a requirement for this software to be implemented in Latin America and another nation where it will be used.
